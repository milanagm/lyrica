*IDEA #1:* 

1. What are we building? 
   We are building a website that displays a full-screen video of "Dancing Trump" every day. The video changes daily, but only one video is displayed per day. Even if the website is refreshed multiple times, the same video will remain for that day. The website will fetch dance moves from popular sources (e.g., YouTube or TikTok), ensuring that each day features a new mainstream dance performed by Trump.

2. Why are we building? 
   The project is being created to:
   a) Celebrate the new President of the United States.
   b) Provide entertainment value to the audience.

3. API usage:
   TikTok Video Downloader API: https://rapidapi.com/elisbushaj2/api/tiktok-video-downloader-api
   to download a dancing video

3. **Idea:**

   • Title: Mood Background Sounds for Elevated Screen Reader Experience

   • Summary: This proposed web application creates “mood backgrounds” for screen reader users, reimagining screen-reading as a multi-sensory experience. Unlike standard screen readers that only transcribe content, this app enhances the listening experience by capturing the “vibe” or “mood” of digital content. Users might hear ambient sounds, music, or tonal shifts that reflect the emotional tone of material—similar to how sighted users gain context through visual cues like Instagram images or article layouts. To ensure flexibility, this feature is designed to be optional, allowing users to enable it based on context and preference. The app includes two main features:

        User Selection: Users can choose a mood or tone, triggering background sounds and cues to match.
        Auto Detection: Automatically interprets content mood (e.g., analyzing “alt” text or book passages) and generates background audio cues accordingly.

   • Accessibility Features: Screen-reader compatibility, ambient audio cues, optional audio descriptions, and volume/pitch adjustments for personalization.



4. **Plan for External API:**

   • Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech API for auditory feedback (since it offers more customization for emotion/tone)

   • Freesound Sound API for ambient or mood-based sounds (since it offers great variety of sounds for moods and vibes, including nature sounds. It's also free)
